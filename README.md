# GeneBe Hub

GeneBe Hub is an open, public repository of Genetic Variant Annotation Databases. It provides a standardized platform for creating, sharing, and applying genetic variant annotations in a unified format. 

## Why GeneBe Hub?
Interpreting genetic variants requires vast amounts of data, often scattered across different databases with inconsistent formats. GeneBe Hub addresses these challenges by providing:

- **A standardized format** for variant annotations ([Learn more](https://genebe.net/about/hub-format)).
- **A client application** to apply annotations to VCF files ([GeneBe Client](https://github.com/pstawinski/genebe-cli/releases)).
- **A centralized platform** for sharing and discovering genetic variant databases ([GeneBe Hub](https://genebe.net/hub)).

## Getting Started
1. **Explore databases**: Browse GeneBe Hub to find useful annotations.
2. **Apply annotations**: Use the GeneBe Client to apply annotations to your VCF files.
3. **Create & share**: Develop your own annotation databases and publish them on GeneBe Hub.

Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://genebe.net/docs/getting-started) for detailed instructions.

## Background
Understanding the impact of genetic variants requires access to multiple data sources, such as:
- **SNPeff / VEP** – Predict variant effects and affected genes.
- **gnomAD / ALFA** – Provide population frequency data.
- **ClinVar** – Catalog known pathogenic variants.

Despite the wealth of information available, there is no universal format or standard method for distributing and applying these databases. GeneBe Hub fills this gap.

## Current RFC: Improving the GeneBe Hub Format
We are currently discussing improvements to the GeneBe Hub format, including new annotation types and better integration with existing tools. We welcome feedback and contributions.
